**Carl is an active owner and developer-emeritus**,
providing oversight and counsel
to the development team.
He is a core developer of the [Django][django] Python web framework,
an elected member of the inaugural [Django technical board][django-tb],
former maintainer of the widely-used [pip][pip] and [virtualenv][virtualenv]
package management tools,
co-author of multiple accepted
enhancements to the Python language and ecosystem,

When not chasing more elegant algorithms,
he chases frisbees, hockey pucks, and a pair of sons.
