**David is a developer emeritus**
(now working with [Salesforce.org][salesforce])
who co-led our server-side development --
managing code architecture,
database design,
and deployment.
He has been building web-based software
in Python and JavaScript for over a decade.
A prolific contributor
to the Plone web content management system,
he enjoys learning new tools --
most recently React, elasticsearch,
and the Pyramid web framework.
When he's not coding,
David can be found experimenting in the kitchen.
