summary: |
  **OddBird stands with the Black community 
  in grieving and protesting racist police violence and murder.** 
  We must all demand an end to the 
  state-sanctioned assault on Black people, 
  and take action to confront anti-Blackness in all our systems. 
  There is much to do, but one action is simple and clear: 
  we want to support the organizations 
  already working in the streets and behind the scenes -- 
  and **we're inviting you to join us**.

      #BlackLivesMatter was founded in 2013
      in response to the acquittal of
      Trayvon Martin's murderer.
      Their mission is to eradicate white supremacy
      and build local power to intervene in violence
      inflicted on Black communities
      by the state and vigilantes.
      We'll match direct donations to BLM
      or anyone
      they list on their donation page.

## Neutrality is Not an Option

We understand that software is political, tech is complicit, and
anti-Blackness is systemic to our nation and our industry. We'll
continue to fight for diversity & inclusion in our communities, in our
work, and in our own company -- from training & hiring, to equal pay,
speaking opportunities, mentorship, decision-making, and shared
ownership.

**We are not neutral.**
