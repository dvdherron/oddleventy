summary: |
  These days, browsers are far more consistent in how they render CSS,
  but they're limited on how far they can improve their User Agent Stylesheet.
  The defaults for the web have to be consistent with the past,
  and any changes would break millions of existing sites.

  You don't have to stay in the past.
  **CSS Remedy (by Mozilla) provides a more modern proposal
  for how CSS should work by default**.
