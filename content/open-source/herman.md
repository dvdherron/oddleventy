      Herman is my documentation dream come true,
      especially when it comes to systems design.

summary: |
  **Design systems streamline development, communication, and
  consistency** --but often rely on dedicated teams and extended budgets.
  We wanted a tool that helps create and maintain living style guides &
  pattern libraries in an agile process, and on a budget. Herman helps you
  keep your development process simple --and your UX consistent --as you
  iterate on patterns and scale over time.

  Start [using Herman] or [hire us] for design systems training.

## Give Your Design System a Home

Documentation should be the default option --the path of least
resistance for developers. Herman combines documentation of design
tokens and system guidelines, with code patterns, components, and
rendered visual examples -- all driven by Sass and CSS. By automating as
much of the documentation as possible, you can help ensure that
everything stays up-to-date for long-term maintainability.

Help improve communication across stakeholders, with consistency in UX,
performance, and accessibility --while reducing technical debt and
minimizing long-term maintenance. Herman is designed to grow with you,
and keep everything in one place.

### Herman's Current Features

-   Supports all [SassDoc] annotations and configuration settings
-   Integrated with Sass/CSS for better automation
-   Visualize design tokens like fonts, colors, sizes, ratios, and icons
-   Display Sass mixins and [Nunjucks] macros with expected input and
    rendered examples
-   Include additional prose, pages, and links to third-party docs
-   Encourage self-documenting patterns, without locking yourself in
-   Optionally integrate with OddBird's [Sass Accoutrement] libraries
