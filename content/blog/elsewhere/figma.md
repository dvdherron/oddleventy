summary: |
  Figma asked 18 designers (including me) what UI/UX trends they predict
  for 2018. December, with its flurry of holiday parties, cheery
  out-of-office auto-replies and introspective weather patterns, provided
  the perfect opportunity to pause and survey the landscape.

## Improvements in CSS will affect web design in surprising ways

There’s a lot to be excited about in CSS — integrating new tools,
like Grid and Custom Properties,
with existing features like Calc and Viewport Units.
Modern CSS allow a new level of interaction,
responsiveness, and data-visualization
that previously required extensive Javascript involvement.
I’m excited to see what new trends grow out of that technology.
