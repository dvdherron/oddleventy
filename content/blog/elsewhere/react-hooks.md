summary: |
  *Hooks* are the new hotness in building web applications with React. In
  this article for BitSrc, Erica separates fact from hyperbole to examine
  why OddBird has embraced the new Hooks API to deliver a better product
  to clients, and how we've benefited from having simple, consistent
  patterns to manage state and share logic across components.
