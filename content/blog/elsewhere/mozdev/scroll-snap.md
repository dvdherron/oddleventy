summary: |
  When we're scrolling down a page, or through a gallery of images,
  snap-targets can help guide us from one section or image to the next. In
  the past, developers have used JavaScript to hijack scrolling, but now
  we can manage scroll alignment directly in CSS with only a few lines of
  code.

The fallback even works well in old browsers!
