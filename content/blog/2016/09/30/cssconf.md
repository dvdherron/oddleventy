Thanks to [Nicole Sullivan] for founding the series, [Bocoup] for
hosting the event, [Claudina Sarahe] (an OddBird alum) for her amazing
emcee-ing, all the other speakers for their inspiring talks, and
everyone else for attending! It was a great atmosphere, and I met all
sorts of lovely people.

My talk was called **Sass Map Magic** – a major update to a talk I had
given several years back at BlendConf (may it rest in peace). The
[slides] and [video] are both available online.

I took extensive notes on day one, but lost my focus on day two, when I
was part of the lineup. All the talks were great, and worth your time if
you have a chance to watch the videos.

## Creativity in Programming for Fun and Profit

![image]

[Sarah Drasner] talked about programming as a creative act. There is
more than one way to solve any given problem – and different solutions
will come with different trade-offs. It's worth exploring the options,
while keeping in mind that code is a communication tool, and you should
engineer with maintainers in mind.

In the second part of the talk, Sarah listed several tools for creative
thinking. I have found all these tools particularly helpful as an
artist, and it was a nice reminder that they can apply to code as well.

1.  Question the base premises
2.  Impose artificial bounds
3.  Repurpose existing solutions
4.  Combine existing solutions
5.  Use open source code (this seems like an extension of 3 and 4)

Of course, this summary barely does justice to the beautiful
demonstrantions Sarah included. Check out her [CodePen] page for a whole
load of amazing and beautiful samples.

## No Bugs in Sight

![image][1]

[Brian Jordan] talked about automated front-end testing, with tools like
[PhantomJS]. He works with [code.org], a non-profit working to increase
student access to computer science curriculum across demographics.

I didn't take thorough notes on his overview of PhantomJS, but there
were a few philisophical points that stood out:

-   Test everything
-   Make sure everyone on the team can write tests for the code they
    write
-   Take the time, on occasion, to review and clean up your tests –
    otherwise you will run into bloat and compile-time issues

## Nativize Is the New Normalize

![image][2]

[Jessica Lord] showed us how to use [Electron] to build native (Mac,
Windows, Linux) desktop applications using Node, HTML, and CSS – with
simplified access to native APIs.

That was pretty cool, but then she got to the point of the talk title:
CSS to help "nativize" your styles, so your app feels like desktop
software, and not a website.

Since Electron uses the latest Choromium rendering, you don't have to
target multiple browsers – but you do have to contend with multiple
operating systems. Among other things, she advised disabling <span
class="title-ref">cursor: pointer</span> and "rubber-band" scrolling.

## Component-Based Style Reuse

![image][3]

[Pete Hunt] gave the most controversial talk of the conference,
exploring the advantages of in-line CSS generated by JavaScript, using
tools like [React], [JSX], and [JSX Style]. It's the obvious solution if
you hate the cascade or think the separation-of-concerns is over-rated.
I don't.

From the JSX perspective, CSS has several major problems:

-   It was designed for documents, not apps
-   The cascade was intended to merge author & user styles, a feature
    that is rarely used (I'm not sure about that claim)
-   The global name space leads to regular class-name conflicts

The React approach:

-   No static HTML, all DOM nodes are generated with JS
-   Build components out of other components
-   Single-class selectors *only* (e.g. BEM) for unambiguous
    name-spacing of classes
-   Class-names referenced only once in JS,  private to the component,
    and functionally equivalent to inline styles

Of course, this causes some new issues that have to be solved by the JS
processor:

-   Adding new custom attributes to the syntax for handling
    pseudo-elements
-   Performance issues (addressed by "injecting" styles)
-   Server rendering is difficult, maybe Webpack can provide a solution?

## CSS4 Grid: True Layout Finally Arrives

![image][4]

[Jen Kramer] provided an overview of past and present CSS layout
techniques, and an introduction to the new [CSS Grid] feature (still
only available behind flags).

None of the existing options were designed for page layout. Tables were
designed for tabular data, floats for inline content wrapped by text
(like images and callouts), and flexbox for gallery-style UI components.

All of them deal with layout along a single axis of flow – what Jen
referrs to as "one-dimensional" layout. To use any of them for layout,
we have to include "row" markup to handle the second dimension.

CSS Grids are substantially different, providing layout options along
both dimensions, and changing the way we think about flow. No row markup
is required, because rows are handled directly in the CSS syntax, and
elements can be rearranged (think flexbox <span
class="title-ref">order</span>) along both dimensions.

The spec is mostly complete but [implementations are sparse], hidden
behind flags, and buggy across all browsers. Jen recommends using Chrome
to explore the new possibilities – but it will be some time before we
can use it in production.

## Silky Smooth Animation with CSS

![image][5]

[Will Boyd] provided guidelines for creating smooth animations in CSS.
To avoid jank, you have to keep all animations and transitions at 60fps.

By breaking performance down into multiple steps (loading, rendering,
painting, displaying), Will was able to isolate the main causes of
"jank" and show us where to focus our efforts.

*Loading* the DOM tree from HTML is outside the scope of CSS animations
– so not a central issue for frame-rate (though unrelated background
loading can slow down overall performance for non-accelerated
animations).

*Rendering* the DOM tree into a visual layout requires matching CSS to
DOM elements. The hardest part is determining geometry and position in
the flow. Re-rendering also requires a re-paint, so anything that forces
the document to re-calculate flow is going to cause performance issues.
Avoid reflow by avoiding changes to properties like `height`, `width`,
`margin`, `padding`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `font-size`, and
so on.

*Painting* the rendered layout into individual pixel bitmaps is mostly a
matter of color and style. Avoid re-paints by avoiding properties like
`color`, `background`, `box-shadow`, etc. Re-paint rarely causes
re-flow, so these properties are a smaller drain on performance.

*Displaying* painted pixels onto the screen is handled by the GPU, and
there are several CSS properties that have been GPU-accelerated – 
meaning they will never cause a re-flow or re-paint. That includes
`transform`, most `filter` values (except for `drop-shadow` and `blur`),
and `opacity`.

All of these aspects can be tracked in browser Dev Tools, and Will
provided great demonstrations to show the differences in performance,
and ways to use accelerated properties to achieve affects you might
initially try to achieve with other properties.

## Stop Thinking in Pixels

![image][6]

[Keith J. Grant] argued for using a combination of `em` and `rem`
values, instead of `px`, for sizing on the web.

Interesting metaphor to "kick" it off: when runners wear softer shoes,
they instinctively step harder – negating any medical benefits. Keith
suggests that we often do the same with relative units – trying to
reverse-engineer pixel values, when we could simply trust the
abstration. We all need to learn how to "step softer" with our relative
units.

Since `em` units are relative to *inherited* font size, they pose a
particular confusion – two `em` values in the same block can render to
different sizes:

    // assuming a 16px default inherited font size
    .title {
      font-size: 1.2em; // 19.2px relative to default font-size
      padding: 1.2em; // 23.04px relative to adjusted font-size
    }

Add in nesting, and the problem gets worse. Using `rem` (root-relative)
units in some situations can help provide a more reliable baseline.
Keith recommends:

-   Always use `rem` for `font-size`
-   Use `px` for border-width, since you often want thin lines
-   Use `em` for *everything else*
-   Line heights remain unitless

In order to ensure that modular components work anywhere, Keiths sets a
`rem` font-size on the container of every component. Internal elements
will be relative to that component root, even when nested inside another
component.

I thought that was clever, but haven't had a chance to play with it. We
have generally reverse-engineered pixel values, and I appreciated the
reminder that it's probably not worth our effort. We'll have to think
about that more.

Keith also provides more detail on using viewport-relative `vw` units
for your root font-size. Hint: they work great inside `calc()`, but
provide terrible results on their own.

## CSS Variables: var(--subtitle)

![image][7]

[Lea Verou] demonstrated various ways to use native CSS variables (AKA
CSS Custom Properties) – already available in all modern browsers aside
from IE/Edge.

As a side note: Lea live-codes her entire talk, and it's amazing to
watch. I learned (after the fact) that she has speaker notes overlayed
directly on her slides at low color contrast – invisible to the
audience, because projectors can't handle the subtlety, but clearly
visible on her own screen. I love it.

She covered a lot of material, but here are a few things that stood out
to me:

The first CSS variable was `currentColor`, added to Opera in 2009. The
new CSS variables are actually more like custom properties, written with
an "empty" prefix (e.g. `--property`) – and solve a much different issue
than Sass variables by inheriting as part of the DOM. Here's a basic
example for defining and accessing a custom property:

    .this {
      --color: blue;
      color: var(--color);
    }

You can use an `@supports` block to add custom properties to your site
as progressive enhancements:

    @supports (--css: variables) {
      // etc
    }

    @supports not (--css: variables) {
      // etc
    }

By default, custom properties are inherited. You can turn off
inheritance for a property, by resetting its value to `initial` in a
universal selector:

    * { --property: initial; }

A few use-cases to note:

-   Apply variables inline, to create variations on a global style e.g.
    `style="--color: blue"` on a button element – especially when using
    JS to adjust styles, so the logical definitions remain in CSS
-   Change a `--gutter` variable at different viewport sizes, instead of
    re-defining your gutter properties directly
-   Create property shortcuts with pre-filled default "theme" values
-   Create custom long-hands for changing a single aspect of a
    short-hand property like `box-shadow`

You can also use custom properties to handle autoprefixing, or setting
multiple properties at once. Setting the global value to `initial`
ensures that nothing new is applied by default, but any new value will
be applied to all the properties at once:

    * {
      --clip-path: initial;
      -webkit-clip-path: var(--clip-path);
      clip-path: var(--clip-path);
    }

Some custom-property gotchas:

-   Properties are case-sensative
-   Don't work well inside the `url()` function
-   Can't have an empty value `:;` but they can have a single space
    value `: ;`
-   Values are typed token lists, so you can't do things like
    `var(--size)em` to add units to a number
-   Adding units is simple using e.g. `calc(var(--size) * 1em)`, but
    there is no good way to remove units – so it is often best to store
    unitless values, and only add the units when they are needed.
-   Variable definitions (`--my-color`) won't animate, but you can
    animate properties (`background: var(--my-color)`) that call the
    variable, and achieve the same outcome.

There's so much more! I highly recommend watching the video.

## Creative Solutions for Creative Design Challenges with CSS and SVG

![image][8]

[Sara Soueidan] was scheduled to talk about SVG, but talked instead
about hacks that she has learned to appreciate while working on the
redesign of a major site. I found it hard to take good notes – but this
talk is well worth the watch. So much good material in here!

[Henri Helvetica] talked about optimizing page and image sizes for the
web. Did you know mp4 videos have better performance than gif images?
Sites like Twitter convert your animated gif into mp4 format for
display.

## It's Time To Ditch the Grid System

![image][12]

[Emily Hayman] demonstrated the ins and outs of using flexbox to build
"content-driven" layouts, instead of forcing our content into grid
colums. It's a great overview, and I particularly resonate with the
"step lightly" philosophy that was repeated here. If you need a
refresher on the *how* and *why* of flexbox, this is a great place to
start.

## Bauhaus in the Browser

![image][13]

[Justin McDowell] used CSS transforms, grids, and more to bring
[Bauhaus]-inspired art and layouts to the browser. It's a fun and
beautiful talk, that includes a demonstration of "Dolly zoom" (also
known as the "vertigo effect") in CSS.

## Coding is a Privilege

![image][15]

[Alisha Ramos] closed out the conference with a rousing talk about
diversity (and privilege!) in tech. A few take-aways:

-   It's important to be aware of the privileges that got you where you
    are.
-   Diversity is not *just* a pipeline issue. Representation is worse in
    the workforce than it is in training programs. A pipeline is only as
    useful as the place it takes you.
-   Culture-fit can be problematic when it refers to "drinking buddies"
    instead of shared values.

I would have taken better notes, but I was too busy applauding. This was
a great way to end the conference. You should [watch the video], and I
should find my local [Black Girls Code] (or similar) to volunteer.
