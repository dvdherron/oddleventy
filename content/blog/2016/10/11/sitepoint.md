summary: |
  I did a [live Q&A at SitePoint] back in August. We talked about
  customizing Susy for your needs, why you might not need a grid system,
  other tools I'm working on, and how to select or build your own
  toolkits.

  It was a wild two-hours of typing as fast as I could, and hoping to
  sound intelligent. Thanks for asking the questions!

> To be clear: now that we have border-box sizing, grid math can be much
> simpler. Complex math is only required if you are using margin-based
> gutters. Move your gutters into padding, and the math is simple.
> That's why I don't use Susy (or any grid system) much any more.
> `percentage(1/5)` works great in Sass -and flexbox takes care of the
> rest.
