summary: |
  Ongoing education in our industry is a must. Attending conferences is a
  great way to learn and network with other industry professionals.
  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to attend conferences,
  but have no fear! Many of the best conferences post videos online,
  giving our community an easy way to learn on our own time
  from anywhere in the world.
  Our first video in this series is a talk by Sarah Parmenter titled
  "Designing Using Data" given at [An Event Apart Orlando].

In her presentation, [Sarah Parmenter] walks us through a journey of
using research throughout the design process to make informed decisions.
While she is known for her work in user interface design, she goes
beyond designing screens and showcases how she created a successful
(non-web design) business by focusing on every detail of a customer’s
experience.

I've personally struggled with accepting data from tools like analytics
and a/b testing at face value. While the raw data is reliable, the human
interpretation and organization of that data to provide meaningful
insight is where my hesitation begins. I've seen experts rely far too
heavily on data without considering the context of their visitor's
situation, emotional state and more. Sarah’s talk showcases how you can
use both research and experience to create the best results.
