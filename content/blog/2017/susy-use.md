summary: |
  **Most grids change with the viewport --
  and Susy needs new settings at each breakpoint.**
  Susy3 is designed without mixins for complete flexibility
  from project to project,
  but it can be useful to build additional tools and shortcuts as you go.
  Here are some snippets to help you get started working with Susy
  across different media queries.

## CSS Variables & Media Queries

The ideal combination of media queries and grid-changes would
automatically apply changed variables at different screen widths. We can
actually see that ideal in action with CSS variables, where the change
can be scoped to DOM states, like viewport width:

```scss
:root { --columns: 2; }

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  /* the new settings will apply to all elements */
  /* above a viewport width of 30em */
  :root { --columns: 6; }
}
```

Because CSS variables inherit in the DOM like any other CSS property,
the effects of a variable-change propagate out to each grid element.
Here's a more complete example of CSS-Variable grids and breakpoints in
action:

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='NadbNR',
  title='CSS Variable Breakpoints',
  user='mirisuzanne'
) }}

## Sass Limitations

In Sass, variables inherit based on source order rather than DOM
structure. That means variables are not able to propagate based on a DOM
concept like viewport width. We have to apply the *results* of our
variable-changes explicitly anywhere we want them used.

Rather than simply setting a new variable at our desired query, we also
have to explicitly call any grid functions – like `span` or `gutter` –
that will generate new output with those new settings. We have to reset
the variables *and* redo the math. If we set width earlier using `span`
and expect that width to change, we'll have to call `span` again to get
the new output:

```scss
// Initial Sass Layout
$susy: (
  'columns': susy-repeat(4),
  'gutters': 0.5rem,
);

.item {
  width: span(2); // 2 of 4
  padding: gutter(); // 0.5rem
}

// Sass Media Query
@media (min-width: 30em) {
  // We have to change the global variable
  $susy: (
    'columns': susy-repeat(6),
    'gutters': 1rem,
  );

  // And explicitly redo all the math...
  .item {
    width: span(2); // 2 of 6
    padding: gutter(); // 1rem
  }
}

// If we're not careful,
// the $susy variable changes aren't contained to the media query
```

This is a major limitation of pre-processing, and one of the main
reasons I'm excited about CSS variables. In the meantime, there are some
tricks we can use to help simplify grid changes in Sass and Susy.

## Susy-Use Mixin

We'll need a mixin that changes our global settings for a block of
wrapped code – using the `@content` argument. We can pair that with a
media query to define the proper settings for a particular screen:

```scss
$medium: (
  'columns': susy-repeat(8),
  'gutters': 1em,
);

// any code out here uses the global $susy settings...

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  @include susy-use($medium) {
    // any code in this block will use the $medium settings...
  }
}
```

Of course, Susy3 doesn't have a `susy-use` mixin, so we'll have to add
one:

```scss
@mixin susy-use(
  $config
) {
  //  parse and normalize any shorthand arguments
  $config: susy-compile($config);

  // record the global settings -
  // and update the global variable with our new settings
  $global: $susy;
  $susy: map-merge($susy, $config) !global;

  // any content inside this mixin
  // will use the local settings
  @content;

  // return the global variable to its initial value
  $susy: $global !global;
}
```

## Susy-At Mixin

If we want to be more explicit about linking breakpoints and settings,
we can write another mixin to associate the two. Each breakpoint will
need a map of Susy settings, as well as the media query values (e.g.
`min-width: 30em`):

```scss
// it is safe to add non-Susy data to Susy maps
$medium: (
  'min-width': 30em,
  'columns': susy-repeat(8),
  'gutters': 1em,
);

// any code out here uses the global $susy settings...

@include susy-at($medium) {
  // this block establishes a new breakpoint,
  // and any code in this block will use the $medium settings...
}
```

Again, we'll have to define the mixin. There are several ways to do it,
depending on the exact syntax you want, but here's my first attempt
(using the `susy-use` mixin we created above):

```scss
@mixin susy-at(
  $config
) {
  //  parse and normalize any shorthand arguments
  $config: susy-compile($config);

  // build min-and-max queries
  $min: map-get($config, 'min-width');
  $min: if($min, '(min-width: #{$min})', null);
  $max: map-get($config, 'max-width');
  $max: if($max, '(max-width: #{$max})', null);

  // combine them if we need both
  $and: if($min and $max, '#{$min} and #{$max}', null);
  // or fall back to the value we need...
  $query: $and or $min or $max;

  // apply the results...
  @media #{$query} {
    @include susy-use($config) {
      @content;
    }
  }
}
```

## Adjust for Your Project

Since this is not core Susy code, we can change the syntax however we
like to fit our individual projects and conventions more closely. If we
wanted to match the Susy2 syntax, we can rename `susy-use` to
`with-layout`, and add an argument for cleanly overriding (rather than
inheriting) the global defaults.

```scss
@mixin with-layout($config, $clean: false) { /* ... */ }
```

For the Susy2 media query syntax, we would rename `susy-at` to
`susy-breakpoint` and separate the media query from the Susy settings,
rather than storing them inside the same map:

```scss
@mixin susy-use($breakpoint, $config) { /* ... */ }
```

That's a bit more flexible – allowing you to associate any breakpoint
with any layout configuration on-the-fly – but I'm not sure that
flexibility is very useful. In most cases, the two should remain
connected.

Your mileage will almost certainly vary, so we recommend experimenting
to find an approach that works for you.

## Sharing Snippets

We'll keep sharing snippets as we encounter them. You can copy-paste
this code and use it as-is – but we recommend playing around, and making
it fit your own project and processes.

If you have more snippets that you've written for Susy3, send them our
way! We love to see how other people are using these tools, and we're
always happy to share the shortcuts you find most useful.

you!
