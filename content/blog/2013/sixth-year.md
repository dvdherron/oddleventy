  A brief review of 2013: OddBird, year six.
date: 2013-12-30
---

As we wrap up our sixth year, it seems like a good time to share our
first-ever year-end retrospective. Here's 2013, OddBird style:

-   [Rachel Nabors][] and [Claudina Sarahe][] joined the team! We're not
    into growth for its own sake (it's taken us six years), but Rachel
    and Claudina kick ass and we're lucky to have them working with us.
-   We had a great time working on [Portfoliyo] with [The K Network] and
    collaborating on a new ed-tech project with [Junyo]. We like solving
    problems that matter.
-   We're slowly developing Miriam's [novel] (which has gotten some
    [rave previews]), and working on a (still pre-alpha) collaborative
    authoring tool.
-   Miriam [spoke] at [SassConf], the [New York Sass & Compass Meetup],
    and the [Brakhage Center for the Media Arts]. She'll appear again in
    2014 at [The Mixin] and others TBA. Carl delivered [a talk] at
    [PyCon] and will speak at [ConFoo] and again at [PyCon] in 2014.
-   [We][] [released][] [code] (and even maintained most of it
    afterwards!) Because we like open source software, and wouldn't be
    here without it.
-   We sponsored [SassConf] and are silver sponsors of [PyCon] 2014.
    It's one way to give back to the communities that have helped form
    our skills and built the tools we use every day.
-   We donated to [PyLadies], the [Ada Initiative], [Black Girls Code],
    and [MACILE]. And you should, too!

Thanks for a great year, everyone. See you around in 2014!
