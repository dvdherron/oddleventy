summary: |
  Since the inception of CSS in 1994, the cascade and inheritance have defined how we design on the web. Both are powerful features but, as authors, we’ve had very little control over how they interact. Selector specificity and source order provide some minimal “layering” control, without a lot of nuance — and inheritance requires an *unbroken lineage*. **Now, CSS Custom Properties allow us to manage and control both cascade and inheritance in new ways.**
