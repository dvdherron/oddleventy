  --but it also seems to be the most contentious and often perplexing.\nIt\u2019s\
  \ too easy and too hard, too fragile and too resilient. Love it or\nhate it, CSS\
  \ is weird: not quite markup, not quite programming in the\nimperative sense, and\
  \ nothing like the design programs we use for print.\nHow did we get here?\n"

CSS is for documents, and also for apps on a universally accessible web.

This is a young platform, and all the core languages are growing fast,
with CSS advancing leaps and bounds over the last few years, but there's
a real problem we can't ignore --the web is *display-agnostic*:

Here we are, putting fonts and colors on the web. But it's worth taking
a step back and asking: what does it even mean to **design** on an
unknown and infinite canvas? This problem isn't new, it's not going
away, and there are no simple answers. Design on the web will always be
weird --but CSS is a [living document], and we have the power to [keep
making it better].
