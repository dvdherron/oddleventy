summary: |
  CSS Grid has been available in most major browsers since early 2017, and
  it makes web layout more powerful than ever before. But complex-looking
  new syntax (line-names! grid-areas! `minmax`! `fit-content`!
  `fr units`!) and missing IE11 support can make it scary to many
  developers.
