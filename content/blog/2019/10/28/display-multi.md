summary: |
  The `display` property has been in CSS from the beginning, handling
  everything from `block` and `inline` boxes to `list-items` and full
  layout systems like `flexbox` or `grid`. Now the `display` syntax is
  getting an upgrade to match its multiple uses.

Learn what's new in the CSS `display` property

The new `display` spec adds `flow` and `flow-root` values, and allows
for setting inner layout (`grid`, `flex`, etc) as well as outer box type
(`inline`, `block`), and more.

It might not be something we use much right away --but it still helps me
understand all the power inside this one property.
