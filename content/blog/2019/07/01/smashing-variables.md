summary: "Miriam takes a deeper dive into the *CSS Custom Properties for Cascading\n\
  Variables* specification to ask, \u201CWhy are they called custom properties,\n\
  how do they work in the cascade, and what else can we do with them?\u201D\nPushing\
  \ past the \u201Cvariable\u201D metaphor, custom properties can provide new\nways\
  \ to balance context and isolation in CSS patterns and components.\n"
