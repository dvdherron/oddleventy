      I consider **Mozilla's MozTrap** to be one of the best
      open source test case management systems out there.

summary: |
  Mozilla's next-generation test case management system, MozTrap manages
  extensive test suites for all of Mozilla's software products (including
  Firefox, Thunderbird, Firefox OS, and others), and allows community
  testers from around the world to run tests on their system and report
  results back to Mozilla, which MozTrap aggregates into reports for
  product managers. MozTrap also includes a RESTful JSON API to allow
  automated tools to run tests and report results.
