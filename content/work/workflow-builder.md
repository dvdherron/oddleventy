      The Workflow Builder project met and exceeded expectations.
      The project was finished in budget and on time,
      and we were super excited to get the outcome we did.

      We appreciate that thereâ€™s not one package deal at OddBird.
      Depending on the project,
      different configurations of the OddBird team
      were able to integrate with our internal developers.
      That worked really well.
