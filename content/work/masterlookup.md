summary: |
  With custom interactive in-browser maps, MLT streamlines the Providence
  Plan staff's task of mapping street addresses to deeded land parcels. In
  addition to allowing batch imports of large numbers of addresses from
  CSV files recording user-selected associations between addresses and
  parcels, MLT records an audit trail of all data changes and allows
  one-click rollback of any change. We worked closely with ProvPlan staff
  to ensure the tool was easy to understand, efficient, beautiful, and a
  pleasure to work with. MLT also includes a RESTful JSON API for querying
  address mapping data.
