      OddBird is high-caliber and nimble.
      Innovative at heart.
      Together,
      **we fundamentally transformed
      the Chicago public school system.**

      **I really enjoy this iterative design process.**
      Seeing how OddBird does the iteration
      has improved my own iterative system with schools.

      Oddbird was the wise investment.
      We could have selected a cheaper avenue for this work --
      **we would have paid for it manifold in the long run**.

      The internet was useless in deciding who to hire,
      with too much conflicting info.
      Then I found OddBird,
      providing **a focused team
      with a wide range of talent.**

      OddBird allowed me to **transform my vision
      into an MVP that has momentum**.
      I'm confident I'll be able to land big venture capital
      and increase my revenue from courses,
      because the tool has sped up the process.

      I love working with Miriam as a project manager,
      She's excellent at reigning me in.

      When we were close to testing with actual users,
      I started to panic.
      But Miriam asked "what do you need?"
      and then we built that, and it worked.

      OddBird already had so many processes
      in place as a team
      and knew how to work together;
      that allowed us get to where we are now.
