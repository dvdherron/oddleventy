summary: |
  Quarq Race Intelligence captures and interprets race performance and
  state-of-play information, and delivers that data in real time to
  spectators, commentators, race officials, third-party analysis software
  and visualization tools. Integrating with Quarq's telemetry and
  reporting hardware, the app shows racers' positions, direction, speed,
  heart-rate, and a number of other statistics in real time. Our
  mobile-optimized web interface has been used for bicycle races,
  triathlons, and non-competitive events, including regular IronMan and
  Enduro races.
