summary: |
  How do we write code that is modular & maintainable,
  in a language designed to be systematic & contextual?
  Over the years developers have explored various programming methods,
  frameworks, and naming conventions to achieve that goal --
  from Nicole Sullivan's OOCSS and Natalie Downe's CSS Systems,
  to BEM, SMACSS, ITCSS, CUBE,
  and recent attempts at purely "functional" or "utility-based" CSS.

We'll look at what these systems have in common,
where they differ,
and how the Cascade changes everything we know about
writing resilient code.
