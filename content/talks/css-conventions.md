summary: |
  How do we write code that is modular & maintainable,
  in a language designed to be systematic & contextual?
  Over the years developers have explored a range of techniques,
  frameworks, and naming conventions to achieve that goal --
  from Nicole Sullivan's OOCSS and Natalie Downe's CSS Systems,
  to BEM, SMACSS, ITCSS, CUBE,
  and recent attempts at purely "utility-based" CSS.
---

We’ll look at what these systems have in common,
where they differ, and how they are informed by CSS itself.
By understanding the trade-offs involved,
we can make more informed decisions
about how to mix, match, adjust,
or re-write these conventions to meet our needs.
