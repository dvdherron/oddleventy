OddBird is looking for a **Django Developer** to join the team,
and we'd love to hear from you!

## You:

- Have experience working with Django, and Python more generally
- Care about designing usable and consistent web APIs
  in communication with the front-end developers who’ll be using them
- Know how to design and structure a database
  to handle whatever data model the client’s project needs
- Enjoy solving complex problems with readable, efficient, fully tested code
- Can explain the decisions behind your work, and the tradeoffs involved
- Enjoy the push-and-pull of a tight feedback cycle
- Enjoy exploring outside what you know, and questioning your assumptions
- Are located in a continental North America timezone (Eastern-Alaska)

Our process keeps design and development tightly integrated.
You’ll be mostly working on APIs and integrations with external services,
but caring about the human interface still matters!
Everyone is working together (with clients and users) towards a unified goal.
While we are specifically hiring for Django experience,
we’re interested in the full range of your skills and interests.
