OddBird is looking for a Django Developer to join the team,
and we'd love to hear from you!

## You:

- Have experience working with Django, and Python more generally
- Care about designing usable and consistent web APIs
  in communication with the front-end developers who’ll be using them
- Know how to design and structure a database
  to handle whatever data model the client’s project needs
- Enjoy solving complex problems with readable, efficient, fully tested code
- Can explain the decisions behind your work, and the tradeoffs involved
- Enjoy the push-and-pull of a tight feedback cycle
- Enjoy exploring outside what you know, and questioning your assumptions

## At OddBird, We:

- Are a small team
- Enjoy working collaboratively on complex problems
- Are involved with the vision and direction of the company:
  how we work, who we work for, and how we manage resources
- Are paid a competitive hourly rate, equally across the entire team
- Write tests (100% coverage everywhere, always) and documentation 
- Give and receive code reviews as collaborators
- Have lives & interests outside of work
- Set our own hours, and work from anywhere
  (from about UTC-4 to UTC-8 most of the time, but trips further afield are fine!)
- Listen to users, and enjoy having our assumptions challenged/tested
- Care about diversity in the tech community,
  and work to support underrepresented voices in tech
- Are engaged in the software community –
  writing articles, sharing tools, and giving talks

This isn't a cubicle job with dental, a 401k, and paid vacation.
We're also not a start-up expecting you to work nights and weekends
towards future equity.
This is a contract job with long term potential,
a good hourly rate, and a lot of flexibility.
We work together to find clients,
and we work together to build them the best tools we can.
When there's work to be done,
we all do what we can, and we get paid for our time.

We’re looking for 10-20 billable hours per week to start,
with potential for more.

Our process keeps design and development tightly integrated.
You’ll be mostly working on APIs and integrations with external services,
but caring about the human interface still matters!
Everyone is working together (with clients and users) towards a unified goal.
While we are specifically hiring for Django experience,
we’re interested in the full range of your skills and interests.

## Interested?
