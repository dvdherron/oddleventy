</span>bed.</p>\n<p>But that’s my goal with this site redesign.\nHow much can I change,\n<em>without moving any of the walls</em>?</p>\n<h2>Some background, and<span> </span>goals</h2>\n<p>I’ve had a number of ‘personal’ sites over the years,\nbut landed on this <span>URL</span> in 2015.\nThe first version of this site\nused <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog\">rstBlog</a> –\na small Python static-site generator\nwithout any<span> </span>documentation.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2019,\nI migrated from rstBlog\nonto my current <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> setup –\na complete overhaul of the site,\ninside and out.\nThe demolition was extensive,\nand I likely\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/17/hit-publish/\">broke a few<span> </span>promises</a>.</p>\n<p>This time\nI plan to leave all the\ncontent and Eleventy infrastructure\n<em>basically</em> intact.\nHere are the<span> </span>goals:</p>\n<h3>Clarify the information<span> </span>architecture</h3>\n<p>I’ve always found it hard\nto sort my activities\ninto organized ‘categories’,\nso I’ve been treating basically everything\nas an <em>event</em>\nwith the same data, look, and feel.\nSomething happens –\na presentation, performance, album release, novel, article, spec –\non a particular date,\nwith any number of relevant<span> </span>tags.</p>\n<p>I like some things about that –\nembracing the mess of my <span>ADHD</span> life –\nbut I haven’t yet found a great solution\nfor navigating <span>&amp;</span> displaying it.\nPart of the problem is simply that\neverything looks the same.\nIt would help if site visitors\ncan more easily see the different types of content\nreflected in the design and navigation of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>The previous design also relied heavily\non extra-long ‘calendars’ of content\nat the bottom of every page.\nThat solution felt very bulky to me –\nboth in terms of page-load,\nand user scrolling.\nIt may have been\ntechnically <a href=\"https://humanebydesign.com/principles/finite/\">Finite</a>,\nbut it didn’t always <em>feel</em> as finite\n(or as easy to navigate)\nas I’d<span> </span>like.</p>\n<h3>Clean up the <span>HTML</span> (&amp;<span> </span>Nunjucks)</h3>\n<p>Technical debt often builds up in <span>HTML</span> over time –\nextra wrapping divs, stray classes,\nand other complexities\nthat originate more from style than <em>content</em>.\nIt feels good to clean that out and start fresh.\nSpecifically, I want<span> </span>to:</p>\n<ul><li>Simplify complex Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>Strip out any <span>HTML</span> that is not absolutely<span> </span>essential</li>\n<li>Improve my use of <a href=\"https://microformats.org/\">microformats</a>\n</li>\n<li>Rethink how <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">WebMentions</a> are<span> </span>displayed</li>\n<li>Rethink how user design customizations are<span> </span>provided</li>\n<li>Always improve accessibility where I<span> </span>can</li>\n</ul><p>I hope to end up with an <span>HTML</span> architecture\nthat feels more minimal –\na blank canvas,\nthat I can treat more like a\n<a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">Zen Garden</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://stylestage.dev/\">Style Stage</a>\nfor my <span>CSS</span>.\nMy early websites\n(back in the 00s)\nall had multiple\n‘<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/alternate/\">alternate stylesheets</a>’\nto choose from,\nand I would love to do that<span> </span>again.</p>\n<h3>Make <span>RSS</span> a first-class part of the<span> </span>site</h3>\n<p>While I was working on WebMentions last month,\nI also made major updates to my <span>RSS</span> feed.\nBut I don’t love the way browsers\ndisplay a raw xml file.\nDevelopers may be my biggest audience,\nbut they aren’t my only audience,\nand I want that link to <em>make sense</em>\nand feel like part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>So I looked into it,\nand it seems like I can\n<a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/beginning-to-style-your-rss-feed/\">use <span>XSL</span> and <span>CSS</span></a>\nto better design and integrate that page\nas a part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<h3>Try out new <span>CSS</span> features<span> </span>(slowly)</h3>\n<p>It’s been fun\nworking on new <span>CSS</span> features\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/orgs/w3c\">with the <span>CSSWG</span></a>,\nbut now that those features\n(and more)\nare starting to roll out in browsers\nI want to use them on my<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>Some of features\nare available already,\nor even a few years old.\nThings like\n<code>is()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>:where()</code>,\n<code>min()</code>/<code>max()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>clamp()</code>,\nvariable fonts,\n<code>color-scheme</code>/<code>accent-color</code>,\nand <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/02/21/layers-guide/\">Cascade Layers</a>.\nSome of those were already\nbeing used in the old design,\nbut this time I get to design around them from the<span> </span>start.</p>\n<p>Over the next months and years\nI also hope to start playing with\nsize-based container queries <span>&amp;</span> query units,\nscope,\nsubgrid,\n<a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/\">new color spaces</a>\n(<code>okLCH</code>/<code>display-P3</code>),\nand more.</p>\n<p>I want to take this slow.\nStart simple,\nand build more interesting themes\nas the various features arrive.\nThat means keeping things simple\nfor as long as possible,\nso it’s easy to integrate new ideas\nwithout major<span> </span>rewrites.</p>\n<h3>Highlight user customizations</h3>\n<p>As part of the previous design,\nI launched\n<a href=\"https://www.oddbird.net/cascading-colors/\">Cascading Color Systems</a> –\na tool for giving users\ntotal control over the colors on the site.\nThat was inspired by Håkon Lie’s\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html\">original 1994 <span>CSS</span> proposal</a>,\nwhich includes the following\ntext-art<span> </span>diagram:</p>\n<pre><code>        User            Author\n Font   o-----x--------------o 64%\n Color  o-x------------------o 90%\n Margin o-------------x------o 37%\n Volume o---------x----------o 50%\n</code></pre>\n<p>I still want to explore that idea\nof making the site design interactive,\nbut I don’t want to keep relying on\n<span>HSL</span> colors to make it happen.\nFor now, I’ve removed Cascading Colors,\nwhile I rethink the<span> </span>approach.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to expose the ways\na <span>CSS</span> design is <em>layered</em> –\nfrom specified initial values,\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/07/04/body-margin-8px/\">user agent defaults</a>,\nresets, global typography,\nlayouts, components, etc.\n<em>It’s a cascade!</em>\nWhat if users could turn on and off\nthe various Cascade <em>origins</em>,\nand <em>layers</em>\nto see how the site looks\nat different steps of the process?\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/08/07/minimal/#settings\">Theme Settings</a> below,\nfor a first-draft of the<span> </span>idea.</p>\nspec\n  browser\n  reset\n  default\n  theme\n  Try turning <span>CSS</span> layers on and off…\n  These settings are also saved in `localStorage`,\n  so they persist across visits.\n<p>This idea is absolutely\ninspired by the personal site of\n<a href=\"https://ichimnetz.com/\">Nils Binder</a>.\nNils provides a slider from 0 to 865 lines of <span>CSS</span>,\nwith animated transitions between the styles.\nIt’s a lot of fun,\nand I recommend checking it<span> </span>out.</p>\n<h2>The order of<span> </span>things</h2>\n<p>My instinct was to strip out all <span>CSS</span>,\nand then work on getting the <span>HTML</span> cleaned up\nwhile my site remains ‘naked’ of style.\nI didn’t quite do that,\nbut I’m aiming for something close.\nHere’s what I’ve done so<span> </span>far:</p>\n<ul><li>Remove the old <span>CSS</span><span> </span>(done)</li>\n<li>Begin re-arranging the <span>HTML</span> <span>&amp;</span> Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer reset</code> »\njust the bare minimum needed\nfor <span>HTML</span> tags and attributes to work the way I expect,\nstarting from <a href=\"https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy\"><span>CSS</span><span> </span>Remedy</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer

is still fluid,\nas I try to figure out what I’m doing.\nI’ll keep adjusting the <code>reset</code> and <code>default</code> styles as I go,\nbut hope to leave the <code>theme</code> layer\nas minimal as possible,\nwhile I focus on the architectural<span> </span>issues.</p>\n<p>For now,\nthe <code>default</code> layer has colors based roughly on Firefox\n<a
